# Figma Relay Angular Schematic POC

## Development

First start the schamtic build in watch mode
```npm run build:schematic:watch```

Now link the schematic into node_modules
```npm run link:schematic``` (this only has to be done once)

Then start the demo app (in a seperate terminal window)
```ng serve demo```
